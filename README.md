This is the example project from Bootstrap Your App with AWS-Amplify.

The backend API project can be found here as an example - https://github.com/mwarger/games-app-api

This demo is heavily inspired by serverless-stack.com, adapted to work as a game catalog for demoing featuers of [AWS-Amplify](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/).
